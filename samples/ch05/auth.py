'''Handles credentials and authorization.

This module is used by the sample scripts to handle credentials and
generating authorized clients. The module can also be run directly
to print out the HTTP authorization header for use in curl commands.
Running:
  python auth.py
will print the header to stdout. Note that the first time this module
is run (either directly or via a sample script) it will trigger the
OAuth authorization process.
